        Strictly follow this format:
        {
            "title": "string (roadmap title)",
            "duration_weeks": number,
            "tasks": [{
                "week": number,
                "task": "string (what the user should do)",
                "xp": number (estimated XP for this task),
                "resources": ["string (high-quality link like YouTube video, documentation, or blog article)"]
            }]
        }

        Instructions:
        - Only return the JSON, without any explanation, markdown, or backticks.
        - Each task must be practical and progressive.
        - Include a mix of official documentation, YouTube tutorials, and trusted blog posts (like MDN, freeCodeCamp, or CSS-Tricks).
        - Match the difficulty with the experience level (Beginner = basics, Advanced = deep dives).
        - Prioritize trusted sources like:
        - MDN Web Docs
        - official docs (e.g., react.dev, nodejs.org)
        - YouTube (Fireship, Net Ninja, Traversy Media, etc.)
        - Blogs (freecodecamp.org, css-tricks.com)

        Make sure the JSON is valid and parseable without any formatting characters or errors.`
